    # Maps the given DevRepository to a has that can be consumed by the RightScraper gem
    # TODO: May make sense for  this to a member of the DevRepository class as an instance method.
    #           Also, may want to take a version as a parameter in the future (or not...).
    #
    # === Parameters
    # dev_repo (DevRepository):: core representation of a resource repository
    #
    # === Returns
    # (Hash)::
    #   :repo_type (Symbol):: Type of repository: one of :git, :svn, :download or :local
    #     * :git denotes a 'git' repository that should be retrieved via 'git clone'
    #     * :svn denotes a 'svn' repository that should be retrieved via 'svn checkout'
    #     * :download denotes a tar ball that should be retrieved via HTTP GET (HTTPS if uri starts with https://)
    #     * :local denotes cookbook that is already local and doesn't need to be retrieved
    #   :url (String):: URL to repository (e.g. git://github.com/opscode/chef-repo.git)
    #   :tag (String):: git commit or svn branch that should be used to retrieve repository
    #                       Optional, use 'master' for git and 'trunk' for svn if tag is nil.
    #                       Not used for raw repositories.
    #   :cookbooks_path (Array):: Path to cookbooks inside repostory
    #                                             Optional (use location of repository as cookbook path if nil)
    #   :first_credential (String):: Either the Private SSH key used to retrieve git repositories, or the Username used to retrieve svn and raw repositories
    #   :second_credential (String):: Password used to retrieve svn and raw repositories
