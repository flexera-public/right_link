# === Synopsis:
#   RightScale Agent Watcher
#
#   Agent monitoring intelligence. Will watch a given list of agents for
#   unexpected termination and react accordingly. This can be either simply
#   logging to a given IO stream, restarting the agent or yielding to any
#   arbitrary block passed in during initialization.
