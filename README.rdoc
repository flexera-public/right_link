= DESCRIPTION

== Synopsis

RightLink automates servers configuration and monitoring. It uses RabbitMQ as
message bus and relies on Chef[2] for configuring. RightLink uses RightPopen[3]
to monitor the stdout and stderr streams of scripted processes. Servers running
the RightLink agent configures themselves on startup an register with the 
mapper so that operational recipes and scripts can be run at a later time.

Refer to the wiki (https://github.com/rightscale/right_link/wikis) for up-to-date
documentation.

== Interface

The RightLink agent exposes actors and methods used to schedule the execution
of Chef recipes and RightScripts (shell scripts) and perform other server
management operations. You can find these actors in the 'actors' subdirectory
of RightLink.

RightLink retrieves <i>executable bundles</i> containing all the information
required to run the Chef recipe or RightScript from other agents. An executable
bundle consists of a sequence of Chef recipes and/or RightScripts together with
any required data (Chef attributes, RightScript parameters, packages etc.). The
exact definition can be found in RightAgent[3].

Some of the other agent operations that RightLink relies on:

* booter actor:
  * booter/declare: Set the RightLink version number
  * booter/get_repositories: Retrieve the repositories bundle used to configure the server
  * booter/get_boot_bundle: Retrieve the boot execution bundle
  * booter/get_decommission_bundle: Retrieve the decommission execution bundle

* auditor actor:
  * auditor/create_new_section: Create a new audit section
  * auditor/update_status: Update the current audit summary
  * auditor/append_info: Append information text to the audit
  * auditor/append_error: Append error message to the audit
  * auditor/append_output: Append script output to the audit
  * auditor/append_raw_output: Same as above, but don't append newline character

* forwarder actor:
  * forwarder/schedule_recipe: Request a Chef recipe to be scheduled on this instance
  * forwarder/schedule_right_script: Request a RightScript to be scheduled on this instance

* state recorder actor:
  * state_recorder/record: Record instance state transitions (e.g. <i>boot</i>-><i>operational</i>)

Upon startup the instance agent will first request the boot execution bundle
and run it. If the execution is successful it will then tell the state recorder
actor to transition to the operational state. At that point the agent is ready
to receive requests.

RightLink comes with two command line tools <i>rs_run_recipe</i> and
<i>rs_run_right_script</i> which allow triggering the execution of operational
Chef recipes or RighScript respecively from within the instance itself. These
two command line tools tell the RightLink agent to send a
<i>forwarder/schedule_recipe</i> or <i>forwarder/schedule_right_script</i>
request to the agents that provide these operations. These agents should in
turn call the <i>instance_scheduler/schedule_bundle</i> operation of the
RightLink agent with the right execution bundle.
